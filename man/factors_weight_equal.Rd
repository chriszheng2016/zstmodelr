\title{Compute factors weight for compositing factor by equal-weight method}
\usage{
factors_weight_equal(factors_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{factors_list}{a list of factors.}
}
\value{
a list of factorS weight with colums of factor_name, factor_weight.
}
\description{
Compute factors weight by giving each factor eqaul weight of
\eqn{1/number of factors}. The result of factors weight could be used for
\code{\link{weight_formula}} to build a formula of composite factor
}
