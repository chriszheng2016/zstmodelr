Finally, commit your changes to your local repository with an explanatory message. Pandas uses a convention for commit message prefixes and layout. Here are some common prefixes along with general guidelines for when to use them:

ENH: Enhancement, new functionality
BUG: Bug fix
DOC: Additions/updates to documentation
TST: Additions/updates to tests
BLD: Updates to the build process/scripts
PERF: Performance improvement
CLN: Code cleanup
RSH: research file

The following defines how a commit message should be structured. Please reference the relevant GitHub issues in your commit message using GH1234 or #1234. Either style is fine, but the former is generally preferred:

a subject line with < 80 chars.
One blank line.
Optionally, a commit message body.
Now you can commit your changes in your local repository:

git commit -m
